# Cat Meme Generator

Project from the McWics Hackathon.

Our Project: We've built a fun and interactive website where you can generate cat photos and edit them—like adding accessories, overlays, text, and changing the background color. The inspiration came from meme-generating websites and, of course, our love for cats. So we thought, why not combine the two and create a "cat meme-making website"?

How We Built It: We used HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript to create the website. It features a welcome page, a loading page, and a home page. For the design, we also used Photoshop to create and refine the visuals.

Walkthrough:
- Starting on the welcome page, you're greeted by a cute welcome cat and an interactive "Start" button. Once clicked, it takes you to the loading page.
- On the loading page, you'll see a walking cat that moves slightly to the right to mimic real motion. It even does a spin, similar to a typical spinning icon on loading screens.
- After loading, you're taken to the home page. It contains a lot of features. You can generate cat photos by clicking the button on the right and even choose different cat breeds. From there, you can customize the photos. Add accessories by dragging icons onto the photo, apply different overlays, change the background color, and add text with different fonts. You can drag and drop everything to create your own unique cat meme!

Future Plans: If we had more time, we'd love to add even more features, like additional accessories, more fonts, or maybe even animations.
